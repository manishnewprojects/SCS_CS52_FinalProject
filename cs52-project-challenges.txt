Challenges/Problems
====================

1) I started out by using the code from the battleship example in the book. The first attempt at getting user input ended up as a pop-up box. This is not how I wanted the user to be able to enter their text. I love the Google Keep app and wanted my app to work just like that. I had to figure out how to get a HTML input box by using a constructor like  var name = window.prompt("prompt: ");


2) Second challenge was on how to create a list? My program kept overwriting the list items. Then I realized I had to create an individual HTML line for each entry and then make sure that that line was added to the HTML thus far. If I just attend the last entry to the HTML DIV, it would show only one entry

3) Another interesting challenge was on how to get input on enter key (same as if the button had been clicked). I found the answer on a code snippet on stackoverflow.com
